I'm bored. I don't know what to do. So I decided to fire up Jekyll and start writing.

I didn't even bother to change the default theme. But it's okay. I was planning on building something minimal like this anyway.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
